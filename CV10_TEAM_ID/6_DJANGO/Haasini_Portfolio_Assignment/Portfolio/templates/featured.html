<h1> Featuring Haasini</h1>
<h2>Promptrepo Hackathon</h2>
<h3> I participated in an AI Hackathon along with 2 other Team Members. We developed an AI model called "GENDER RECOGNITION BY VOICE". Participating in this hackathon provided invaluable insights and skills, including problem-solving, teamwork, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies.
Out of 88 competing teams, 25 advanced to the finalsâ€”and our team was one of them!
While we didn't make it to the Top 3, the experience was incredibly rewarding, especially as first-time participants studying in the first year. We gained valuable insights and are excited to continue refining our project.</h3>
<h2>CodeVerse_2025</h2>
<h3>I'm a part of the Codeverse_2025, a summer term course provided by my University. I am able to learn many things such as developing a game using python, working in a team, what is open source and how it works, git and github, and even creating a portfolio using DJANGO, and many more exciting things.
    We are a team of 5, in which, I am a Team Leader. I also get to learn how to manage a team and assigning the works equally to everyone in the team and many more things with this role!
