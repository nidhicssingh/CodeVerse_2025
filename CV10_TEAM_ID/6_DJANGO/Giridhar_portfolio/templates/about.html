        Hi, I'm <strong>Giridhar Gokul </strong>, a passionate and enthusiastic web developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in software engineering at S-VYASA DEEMED TO BE University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building modern, responsive websites using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. My interests also include exploring new technologies, writing clean code, and working on real-world projects that solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I love traveling with nature, Geographical photography, and I'm participating in programs like <strong>CodeVerse</strong>, where I showcased my creativity and technical skills.
