  <h2>About ME</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    Hello! I’m <strong>JAYASHREE</strong>, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at [College Name].  
    I’m passionate about web development and eager to explore new technologies that improve the way we build digital solutions.

  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
    I enjoy learning new programming concepts, and I’ve recently begun building real-world projects to enhance my skills.  
    My strengths include logical thinking, consistent learning, and a strong interest in frontend design.

    Outside of tech, I love spending time sketching, reading, and watching movies.  
    I believe in growing every day — and my portfolio is a reflection of that journey.
