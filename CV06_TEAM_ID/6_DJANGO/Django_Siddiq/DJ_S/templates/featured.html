                <h4>My Contribution</h4>
                <p>
                  During the CodeVerse_2025 program, I developed a Python-based GUI application using Tkinter titled <strong>"AI Career Assistant"</strong>. This project leveraged AI concepts to guide users toward relevant career paths based on their interests and skills. I used <strong>Python, Tkinter, Git, and GitHub</strong> for development and collaboration.

                <h4>Recognition</h4>
                <p>
                  My project was recognized for its practical impact and innovative use of AI for career guidance. The UI/UX design, clean code structure, and real-time recommendations using decision logic stood out. This recognition inspired me to continue working on AI-driven tools for education and empowerment.
