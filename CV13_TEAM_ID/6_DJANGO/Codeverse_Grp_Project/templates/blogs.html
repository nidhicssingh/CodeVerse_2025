<h2>Figuring Out GitHub at Codeverse</h2>
<p>
    During our Codeverse event, one of the most exciting challenges was learning how to use GitHub for the first time. At first, the platform seemed overwhelming with its branches, commits, and pull requests. However, as we collaborated and explored together, GitHub started to make sense.
</p>
<p>
    We began by creating repositories for our projects and learned how to push our code from our local machines to the cloud. Working as a team, we discovered the importance of version control and how it helps us track changes and avoid conflicts. The process of making pull requests and reviewing each other's code taught us the value of teamwork and communication.
</p>
<p>
    By the end of the event, we were confidently using GitHub to manage our codebase. The experience not only improved our technical skills but also brought us closer as a team. Now, GitHub feels like a powerful tool that we can use for all our future projects!
