    <h1>About Me </h1>   
    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Sushma</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a student pursuing my Btech engineering currently in my 2nd year.I spend most of my time exploring areas like Python programming and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
       Iâ€™ve worked on several academic and personal projects that helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of real-world applications.
        I believe in continuous learning and always strive to expand my knowledge both in and outside the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from academics, I enjoy participating in certification courses, learning about new tools, and working on collaborative tech initiatives.
        I also love sharing what I learnâ€”whether it's through blogs, presentations, or real-time meet.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Iâ€™m not with my laptop or out of college, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new cafes,spending time with friends, or testing my limits with new personal challenges.
