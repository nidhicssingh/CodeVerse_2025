                <p>The highly anticipated CodeVerse Summer Special Program officially launched today, marking the beginning of three weeks of intensive learning and boundless innovation! The day commenced with an enthusiastic registration process, followed by an engaging ice-breaking session that helped our participants connect and form teams. A key highlight was the insightful opening address delivered by <strong>Vinay Kumar, Country Head - Pearson India</strong>, on "Bridging Campus to Corporate: Industry Expectations." This foundational session set a clear vision for career readiness.</p>
                <p>Participants were efficiently grouped into three vibrant sections—Section A (Room 14, Ms. Sangeetha), Section B (Room 15, Ms. Sanjana), and Section C (Room 16, Ms. Sai Shree)—each poised for focused learning. The afternoon was packed with foundational technical sessions, including explorations into AWS Cloud Hosting, Open Source in Action, and essential Git and GitHub workshops. We are incredibly excited to witness the blend of technology, creativity, and personal growth that will unfold!</p>
