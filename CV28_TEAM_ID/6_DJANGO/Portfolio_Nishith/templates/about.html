    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Nishith</strong>, a passionate coder who loves turning ideas into reality through the power of code.</p>

    <p>I specialize in technologies like <code>Python</code>, <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, and <code>C++</code>. I enjoy building web applications, solving algorithmic challenges, and exploring automation and game development.</p>

    <p>My journey began with curiosity and quickly became a lifelong pursuit of excellence in software development. I constantly seek to improve my skills and learn new tools and frameworks.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I explore open-source contributions, read tech blogs, and work on personal side projects. My goal is to build meaningful solutions that have real-world impact.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><em>Code is more than syntax â€” it's a way to create, innovate, and change the world.</em></p>
